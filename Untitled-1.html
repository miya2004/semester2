            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Nasmak Pm is a new wave band that is having a crazy chaotic style, their group have the “pm” in their name standing as a plus and minus because they always accept new people coming into the band and also members can leave and return whenever they want. They started writing music in a chicken coop and later on develop their albums. The goal for this project is to make them stand out more but to keep their vibe. They wanted to attract more young generation and wanted to have a “crazy” aura. </p>

        <div id="inspiration" class="section">
            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>To start, I'm going to visualize the new wave fanbase's identity. The first step was to create a <span class="hover-text" id="btnMoodboard">mood board</span>. With this, I create an image of who I want to attract. Then I created a <span class="hover-text" id="btnStylescape">stylescape</span> with the mood board, so that I can already create something visual that suits this fanbase.</p>

            <div class="hover-card" id="showMoodboard">

                    <a href="moodboard.png" class="gallery-image">

                  </div>
                <p>First, I looked online to understand what a new wave punk band's aesthetic is like. I explored their website and Instagram page to see the colors they typically use and the themes of their lyrics. I wanted to get a sense of what they sing about most often. After that, I went to TikTok to observe how fans of this type of music express themselves—how they dress, how their rooms are decorated, and what they like. I noticed that their style is heavily influenced by vintage items, with lots of bright colors and unique, unusual choices. Their rooms are filled with posters, concert tickets, lights, pictures, and drawings—often featuring a colorful or old-paper look. For my mood board, I included an egg and chicken, symbolizing the origins of the band's songwriting process. I also added an image of a girl with green hair, as many fans I saw have brightly colored hair. Overall, I found that the aesthetic is chaotic and vibrant, rather than clean and simple. When I showed my teacher my posters, he mentioned that he prefers a more polished, one-color style and showed me examples of his work, which are very professional and well put together. However, I believe that professionalism doesn't always mean clean and orderly. For a new wave punk band, the goal is to capture the raw, expressive energy of their style. If I were working with this band, I would want to create posters that reflect my own interpretation of their aesthetic, embracing the chaotic and bold vibe that defines their look and sound.</p>

                    1. First stylescape: I think the contrast works well. The band's name is written in a way that gives off an '80s, disco, and vintage vibe. I added chaotic, nighttime-themed pictures to match the energy of their new album, *Dancing Night*. I also included images of a punk group performing live, to reflect the raw, energetic vibe of their music.
                    
                    <br><br>2. Second stylescape: This one is a totally different approach from the new wave style. It’s softer and more aligned with what I would call "white girl music." I wanted to include this to show the band a different direction and see if they’d be open to changing their style. Personally, as someone from this generation, I think soft colours like these would appeal to a lot of people today.
                    
                    <br><br>3. Third stylescape: This is one of my favourites that I created. I stuck with their core colours—red and yellow—while also adding soft pink and dark purple. These colours pop a lot, especially on things like posters, and the red and yellow are a nod to their origins in a chicken coop. I thought it would be nice to keep that part of their history alive visually.
                    
                    <br><br>4. Fourth stylescape: This is like the third one, but I swapped out the red and yellow for blue. I wanted to see how it would look with a different colour scheme.
                    
                    <br><br>The feedback I received from the client is that they don't want to be perceived as a punk band, but rather as a new wave group. So I didn't make change in the stylescape but on my research later on I didn't do it for a punk but for a new wave/ post punk.

                <p>New wave is a music genre that encompasses pop-oriented styles from the 1970s through the 1980s. It is considered a lighter and more melodic "broadening of punk culture
                    "New wave music is a broad subgenre of rock 'n' roll that combines elements of punk rock, mainstream pop music, art rock, synth pop, funk, and reggae.<br>
                   
                   Because the band mentioned that they want to attract a younger generation, I did some research on what new generation actually likes and what is trendy nowadays. I started by looking at the overall most popular and trendy things. One example I came across was the “Rhode” photo booth that Hailey Bieber created in London to promote her new lip gloss. With each photo taken in the booth, people received a lip gloss, and thousands of people queued up from morning till night to take a picture. The "Life4Cut" photo booth, which is really popular among K-pop fans, also caught my attention. People can take photos with the theme of their favorite K-pop bands, and it draws huge crowds.
                   
                   
                   <br><br>Another trend that’s really popular is Spotify. Almost everyone uses it now, and most people won’t listen to music unless it’s available on Spotify because they rarely want to install another app just to listen to a single song. The band already has their music on Spotify, but to make it even more popular, many people have the code to scan and go directly to the music.
                   
                   <br><br>Looking at the Instagram pages of some of the most popular singers, like Travis Scott and Central Cee, who are really popular among the younger generation, I noticed a few trends. Their Instagram feeds often feature two main colors that pop when you see the photo, and the feed usually has 9 photos in total. They also use handwritten fonts and old paper-like posts, and often share behind-the-scenes moments.
                   
                   <br><br> For people into new wave, punk, and similar music genres, I researched TikTok and found that this group also likes vintage products. Their color palette tends to lean towards brownish tones or chaotic mixes of neon colors, with red and yellow being especially popular. Interestingly, every girl I interviewed, even those into this style of music, mentioned they like pink, but there was a split—some prefer hot pink, while others like a softer shade of pink.</p>

                  </div>
                <p>Photo Booth – for the photo booth because the 2 photo booths of Rhode and life4cut are popular so I decided to go with them and make an open-air photo booth to be easily adjusted wherever they want and also to give people memories from the group. Because people that like this type of music like vintage things and in Amsterdam the vintage photo booth is popular. I decided to have 2 options, the first one is to take a photo and have your ticket printed on the back and the second is to just have your photos with the theme of the posters I made with the group and in every event like Christmas you can take even a photo with the band that is dressed with a Christmas theme clothes. 
                    My teacher Anke didn’t like the idea with the printed tickets because this way you will attract more already fans of the band but I wanted to present the 2 options anyway, when I had a interview and user research I often was seeing people hang on their wall or put this kind of memories in their scrapbook or Travis Scott concerts and also Taylor Swift you get a bracelet handmade one that you can keep after the concert. 
                    I made a prototype just to show what can the photo booth looks like if they go with a normal one and one prototyped on my laptop for the open air one. I also made a prototype of the tickets how they can look like. The first picture of the tickets doesn’t have a template, but I showed it to my teacher, and he said to add something that will connect with the posters so after that I added 2 options that are with similar patterns as the posters me and my teammates made

                  </div>
                <p>For the Spotify keychain, I designed a prototype featuring the Nasmak group poster with plus and minus icons. My idea was to have these keychains available at the stand-up booth, so that whenever someone buys a drink, they also get a keychain. Alternatively, they could be sold as "merch" after the concert. The Spotify keychain is really practical because it allows people to scan the code and immediately access the band's songs, rather than having to search for the group manually. If someone recommends the band to someone else, they’re less likely to search it up later. However, if you give them the keychain, they'll be more likely to scan the code out of curiosity and check out the music right away.</p>

                    After making the stylescape I made some posters that will suit for their Instagram page and just for posters to print and have them around the buildings. I made posters for upcoming concerts, posters for their albums and also, I made a few posts for Instagram and highlights that can be used. Posts a lot of artists write down their songs on a vintage paper-like background and also they have handwrited typography with their posters and because the band wants crazy and chaotic vibe I made with the colours posters that have a lot of colours in one but I also made a clean posters and posts so that the 2 main colours are the first thing you see and that their Instagram feed can be really attractive,

                    For their Instagram feed, I suggested posting BTS (behind the scenes) reels after every concert, but we didn't end up using that idea. For the Instagram feed I designed, I used the 9-photo method with 2 main colours that pop and are eye-catching. Having a well themed feed like this can attract more people. For the posters, I suggested they post them as stories and upload them a week before the concert. Including all the relevant links in the bio section for links is helpful rather than putting it in the bio but as a text, and creating a personalized hashtag would allow fans to follow and easily find their content. I also recommended creating a channel to engage with their fans and attract people interested in that genre of music. In this channel, the band could text their fans daily, post little vlogs or updates, and interact more directly with them—rather than just posting a generic picture of what they are eating with the caption "Happy." Underneath there are 9 pictures of the first 9 photos that they can post with yellow and red dominating. (all the pictures used, without the 4th one, are all the band’s pictures and my own posters)
